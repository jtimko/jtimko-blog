          My name is Justin. I work in the public sector as a .NET web
          developer. I also tinker with cyber security, photography,
          videography, electronics, programming, and 3D modeling.

          This site is where I share projects, ideas, and photos. I write
          locally in MDX and publish when I&apos;m ready.
